This is my answer for the question in https://qr.ae/pNvTdB . 
Thereâ€™s an array of heads of linked lists that may or may not intersect with each other. 
The goal is to group the array entries such that if two linked lists intersect 
with each other then they belong to the same group.

Advantage with this code is, this doesn't ;oop till tail to find the grp.
Once it finds that the link is chaned to another linked list, the head is
immediately added to corresponding group.
